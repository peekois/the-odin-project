1. What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?
    External CSS as is a style sheet separate from the HTML file.
    Internal CSS is styles defined at the head element of a HTML file.
    Inline CSS are styles defined to a single element. SHOULD NOT BE USED.

2. What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
    A period immediately followed by case-sensitive value of the class attribute.
    ie. .alert-text

3. How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
    Using grouping or chaining selectors, ie. .alert.text{} or  .alert,
                                                                .text {}

4. Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
    .primary.title{}

5. What does the descendant combinator do?
    A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected,
    if they also have an ancestor that matches the previous selector.

6. Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?
    A class selector will always beat any number of type selectors. So the first rule.
