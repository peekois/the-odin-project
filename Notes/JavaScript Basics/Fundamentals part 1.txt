PART 1


1. Name the three ways to declare a variable?
    var, let and const

2. Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
    var, it is an older way of declaring variables. let and const are the new ones

3. What rules should you follow when naming variables?
    Name must contain only letters, digits or the symbols $ and _.
    First character cannot be a digit.
    When multible words in use camelCase.
    When using constant as an alias use CAPITAL_LETTERS and underscores.
    Use clean, descriptive and obvious variable names.

4. What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?
    When a plus operator is used on string it changes the other operands to string aswell.

5. How does the % operator work?
    It gives the remainder of an integer division.

6. Explain the difference between == and ===.
    Unlike equality operator (==), strict equality (===) always considers operands of different types to be different. 

7. When would you receive a NaN result?
    NaN is a word reserved to indicate that a number is not a legal number.
    Trying to do arithmetic with a non numeric string will result in NaN.

8. How do you increment and decrement a number?
    Addin ++ or -- to the variable name, i.e. ++numberVariable or --numberVariable

9. Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators.
    If we'd like to increase a value and immediately use the result of the operator, we need the prefix form.
    If we'd like to increment a value but use its previous value, we need the postfix form.

10. What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
    Operator precendence in which multiple operarors of expression are executed.
    Order is exponentation > multiplication > division > addition and subtraction > assignment.

11. How do you access developer tools and the console?
    Inspect (ctrl+shift+c on firefox) and in the developer tools select console.

12. How do you log information to the console?
    console.log()

13. What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?
    Unary plus converts a string representation of a number to an integer.
