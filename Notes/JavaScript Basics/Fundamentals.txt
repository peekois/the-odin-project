1. Name the three ways to declare a variable?
    var, let and const

2. Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
    var, it is an older way of declaring variables. let and const are the new ones

3. What rules should you follow when naming variables?
    Name must contain only letters, digits or the symbols $ and _.
    First character cannot be a digit.
    When multible words in use camelCase.
    When using constant as an alias use CAPITAL_LETTERS and underscores.
    Use clean, descriptive and obvious variable names.

4. What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?
    When a plus operator is used on string it changes the other operands to string aswell.

5. How does the % operator work?
    It gives the remainder of an integer division.

6. Explain the difference between == and ===.
    Unlike equality operator (==), strict equality (===) always considers operands of different types to be different. 

7. When would you receive a NaN result?
    NaN is a word reserved to indicate that a number is not a legal number.
    Trying to do arithmetic with a non numeric string will result in NaN.

8. How do you increment and decrement a number?
    Addin ++ or -- to the variable name, i.e. ++numberVariable or --numberVariable

9. Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators.
    If we'd like to increase a value and immediately use the result of the operator, we need the prefix form.
    If we'd like to increment a value but use its previous value, we need the postfix form.

10. What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
    Operator precendence in which multiple operarors of expression are executed.
    Order is exponentation > multiplication > division > addition and subtraction > assignment.

11. How do you access developer tools and the console?
    Inspect (ctrl+shift+c on firefox) and in the developer tools select console.

12. How do you log information to the console?
    console.log()

13. What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers?
    Unary plus converts a string representation of a number to an integer.

1. What are the eight data types in JavaScript?
    Number, bigint, string, boolean, null, undefined, object, symbol

2. Which data type is NOT primitive?
    Object.

3. What is the relationship between null and undefined?
    Both are types of their own. Null is used to assign an empty or unknown value to a variable,
    while undefined is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.

4. What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?
    Single and double quotes do the same thing. A backtick quote is used for template literal.

5. What is the term for embedding variables/expressions in a string?
    A template literal.

6. Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?
    A backtick quote.

7. How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?
    variable = `Text ${variable}`

8. How do you escape characters in a string?
    Backslash before a quote is used to escape the quote mark as not to be recognized as part of the code but part of the text.

9. What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods?
    Slice() extracts a part of the string with parameters of start position and end position. If a parameter is negative it is counted from the end of the string.
    Substring() is similiar to slice() but start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0.
    Substr() is similiar to slice() but the secxond parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.

10. What are the three logical operators and what do they stand for?
    || OR, && AND, ! NOT. 
    OR is TRUE if ANY of the conditions are TRUE.
    AND is TRUE if ALL of the condition are TRUE.
    NOT is used to negate any boolean or logical operator,

11. What are the comparison operators?
    Greater/less than: a < b or a > b.
    Greater/less or equal than: a <= b or a >= b.
    Equals: a == b 

12. What are truthy and falsy values?
    Values or data types that become True are "truthy", i.e if statement
    Values or data types that become False are "falsy".

13. What are the falsy values in JavaScript?
    A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all become false. Because of that they are called “falsy” values.

14. What are conditionals?
    Conditionals are if, else, else if, switch-

15. What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?
    if (condition) {
    code to run if condition is true
    } else {
    run some other code instead
    }

16. What is the syntax for a switch statement?
    switch (expression) {
    case choice1:
        run this code
        break;

    case choice2:
        run this code instead
        break;

    // include as many cases as you like

    default:
        actually, just run this code
    }

17. What is the syntax for a ternary operator?
    ( condition ) ? run this code : run this code instead

18. What is nesting?
    Nesting is when you put a if...else statement inside another one.
