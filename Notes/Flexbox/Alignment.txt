1. What is the difference between justify-content and align-items?
    justify-content aligns items with the main-axis. align-items aligns items with the cross-axis.

2. How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?
    justify-content: center
    align-items: center

3. What’s the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?
    justify-content: space-between, items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line.
    justify-content: space-around,  items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. 
                                    Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. 
                                    The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, 
                                    but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
